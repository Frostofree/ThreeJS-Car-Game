## Student README
The following project is Assignment 2 of the Computer Graphics course in Spring 2023 in IIITH.
It is a Rudimentary car game, built using original models and ThreeJs.
The story is as follows :
McQueeb Is Late For his race as usual, only this time he's utterly screwed. With only half a tank of gas in his engine, he has no Chance of finishing the Race! Luckily for him, his crew had placed fuel cans across the track for him to use, but they're in very limited quantity, so he must be careful with the cans he's using!

Also, the opponents cars are Russian Panzer V ' s from the World war 2, and it is not fun to hit them, losing too much health means it's a game over!

It might also be important to mention that although it seems like Mcqueeb can escape this predicament by simply leaving the stadium, Dr. Nigaboo has installed invisible barriers which will continuously sting poor McQueeb to death, only way to win is to finish First!
